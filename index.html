            <h1 id="title">Cowboy Bebop / カウボーイビバップ</h1>
            <p id="desc">
              In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets
              and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable
              surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police
              attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw
              bounty hunters, referred to as "Cowboys". The ragtag team aboard
              the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals. Mellow and carefree
              Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet
              Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting
              rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that
              they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly
              intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic
              trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid
              Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel
              each member's dark and mysterious past little by little.
              Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy,
              Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the
              smooth and improvised music it is named after.<br /><br />(Source:
